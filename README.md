# Maia


[![CI](https://github.com/sapcc/maia/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sapcc/maia/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

Maia is a multi-tenant OpenStack-service for accessing metrics and alarms collected through Prometheus. It offers 
a [Prometheus-compatible](https://prometheus.io/docs/querying/api/) API and supports federation.

At SAP we use it to share tenant-specific metrics from our Converged Cloud platform
with our users. For their convenience we included a CLI, so that metrics can be discovered and
retrieved from shell scripts.

If you don't use OpenStack, you can still use Maia CLI as a feature-complete shell client for Prometheus. 

## Features

- Multi-tenant Prometheus API offering isolation and resource restriction
- Supports both project and domain-based authentication from OpenStack
- **Global region support** for virtual region metric queries using global keystone authentication
- Fetches required service endpoints from Keystone service catalog
- JSON Web Token validation for the OpenStack Elektra UI

* OpenStack Identity v3 authentication and authorization
* Project- and domain-level access control (scoping)
* Compatible to Grafana's Prometheus data source 
* Compatible to Prometheus API (read-only)
* Supports secure federation to additional Prometheus instances

[Maia UI](docs/users-guide.md#using-the-maia-ui)
* Prometheus expression browser adapted to Maia
* Browse projects and metrics
* Perform ad-hoc PromQL queries
* Graph metrics
 
[Maia CLI](docs/users-guide.md#using-the-maia-client)
* Feature-complete CLI supporting all API operations
* JSON and Go-template-based output for reliable automation
* Works with Prometheus, too (no OpenStack required)

# Using Maia

Maia can be used via Web-UI or CLI.

Enter `maia --help` to see a list of commands and options.

Please refer to the [Maia user guide](./docs/users-guide.md) for more instructions.

# Operating Maia

The easiest way to deploy Maia as a service is Kubernetes.

Feel free to reuse our [Maia helm chart](https://github.com/sapcc/helm-charts/tree/master/openstack/maia)
which includes Maia, Prometheus and Thanos.

Follow the [Maia operators guide](./docs/operators-guide.md) to learn how to setup the 
Maia service from scratch and integrate with Prometheus.

# Integrating and Extending Maia

The [Maia developers guide](./docs/developers-guide.md) describes how to use the Maia API. Also
it contains information how to contribute to the Maia development.
